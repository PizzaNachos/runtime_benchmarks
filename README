# Run timee benchmarks for http servers

planning on benchmarking the following http servers 

Java Quarkus
Java Spring
Rust Axum
Rust Actix 
Nodejs Express
Nodejs Fastify 
Go Gin


Ideally using a combination of metrics
- low compute vs med compute vs high compute
- verifying a JWT
- low vs med vs high blocking time (simulating a database call or other API call) 5ms - 100ms 
- simple ping pong (test pure http implimentation)
- JSON parsing 
- low vs med vs high data using inside server, ex having to parse a 10k json object and sort through it and return certian stuff

stuff into a docker continer to get CPU + Memory metrics out of 
measure all response times and plot against the CPU + memory
